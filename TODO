A GOOD README:
- ._.

POWEROFF KEYBIND:
- Something like Mod+Shift+p
- Preferably run "loginctl poweroff"
- DON'T REQUIRE ROOT

THEME CHANGER SCRIPT:
- Probably just a simple bash script
- Change xinitrc to set a different wallpaper
- Change dwm/st/slstatus/dmenu config files and make clean install
- Preferably reload xorg
- Use config file
	Syntax idea:
	[dwm]
	# It is not necessary to change the color definitions, but it would improve readability, so maybe add that in the future
	SchemeNorm = fg, bg, border
	SchemeSel = fg, bg, border

	[st]
	0 = "#282828"
	1 = ...
	...
	15 = ...

	[wallpaper]
	option = fill
	file = epic_wallpaper.jpg

- Usage: desktop_theme [theme name]



INSTALLER SCRIPT:
- Install packages required for setup to run (e.g. x11 dependencies)
- Download dots repo
- Copy all files and dirs to their intended locations
- Install suckless programs
- User specific
- Distro specific
- Select what to do (similar to make)
- Usage ideas:
	install_dots --distro arch --all larry          - would install dependencies, dotfiles, and suckless programs for user larry
	install_dots --distro gentoo --dots larry       - would install dotfiles for user larry
	install_dots --distro gentoo --deps --sl larry  - would install dependencies and suckless programs for user larry
